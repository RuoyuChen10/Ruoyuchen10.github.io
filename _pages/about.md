I'm **Ruoyu Chen <font face="Ê•∑‰Ωì" >(ÈôàËã•ÊÑö)</font>**, a Ph.D. candidate in Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IIE, CAS), under the tutelage of [Xiaochun Cao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PDgp6OkAAAAJ&hl=en) (Professor at Sun Yat-sen University) and [Rui Wang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~wr) (Professor at Chinese Academy of Sciences). My research interests include *Artificial Intelligence* and *Computer Vision*. My recent research works mainly focus on *Explainable AI*, *Disentangle*, *Few-shot Learning*, which applications in *Human Face*, *Object Detection*. I received my B.E. degree from School of Control Engineering, Northeastern University. During my undergraduate years, my main research interests are the application of artificial intelligence and image processing in agriculture and biomedical engineering.

I am very fortunate to have worked with lots of distinguished researchers: [Hua Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KYifAy8AAAAJ&hl=en) (Associate Professor at IIE, CAS), [Siyuan Liang](https://liangsiyuan21.github.io/) (Research Fellow at National University of Singapore), [Wei Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=B-pQ7nAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) (Post-doc at Sun Yat-Sen University).

I am open for collaborations in research. I am also actively looking for collaborators, especially in the fields of **Trustworthy AI** and **Open World**. Please feel free to contact me.
